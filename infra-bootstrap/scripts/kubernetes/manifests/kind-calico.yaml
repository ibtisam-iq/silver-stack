# kind-calico-cluster-config.yaml

# Description:
# This is the official Kind cluster manifest using Calico as the Container Network Interface (CNI). 
# It defines a Kubernetes cluster with two control-planes (master) node and two worker nodes. 
# This minimal setup is designed for local development and testing purposes, ensuring simplicity and resource efficiency.


apiVersion: kind.x-k8s.io/v1alpha4    # Specifies the Kind API version to use. Kind is a tool for running Kubernetes clusters locally using Docker containers.
                                      # This API version ensures compatibility with the current Kind features and configurations.

kind: Cluster                         # Declares that this is a Kind Cluster configuration file, which tells Kind how to create the cluster.
                                      # This setting defines that we are creating a Kubernetes cluster managed by Kind.

name: ibtisam                         # Name of the Kind cluster. This is an identifier for the cluster, useful when managing multiple clusters.
                                      # Choosing a unique name allows easy identification, especially when multiple clusters are in use.

nodes:                                # Defines the cluster nodes, specifying their roles and configurations.
  - role: control-plane               # Defines a node as a control-plane (master) node, responsible for managing the cluster.
                                      # The control-plane node is the brain of the cluster, handling scheduling, state management, and API requests.
    image: kindest/node:v1.32.3       # Specifies the container image for the control-plane node. Ensures all nodes run the same Kubernetes version.
                                      # Using a specific version ensures consistency and prevents compatibility issues within the cluster.

# Once the cluster is created, you can deploy Calico as the CNI plugin using the following command:

# curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/projectcalico/calico/v3.28.0/manifests/calico.yaml
# sed -i 's/# - name: CALICO_IPV4POOL_CIDR/- name: CALICO_IPV4POOL_CIDR/' calico.yaml
# sed -i 's/#   value: "192.168.0.0\/16"/  value: "10.244.0.0\/16"/' calico.yaml
